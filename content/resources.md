I have found out that sometimes it can be quite difficult to find reasonable book dealing with programming related topic – not only the knowledge can quickly become obsolete, in my experience it has been increasingly more difficult to find publications which are more in-depth than online courses. It’s even harder to find a reliable, curated list of such textbooks.
Therefore, below you can find a list of books I have found to be exceptionally useful / impactful, as a small aid for anyone searching for a good read.
