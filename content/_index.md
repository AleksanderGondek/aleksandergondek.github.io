welcome_msg = "Having over 10+ years of experience in wide range of *-Engineering roles, from Software through System Builds to Software Reliability, I have developed strong opinions and unique insights towards challenges and technologies present in each of those areas, as well as some that cross those boundaries. Said experience made me lean heavily towards tools that are reliable and designed to solve particular problems at hand. This blog is an attempt to share my knowledge (and ramblings), in a structured way that hopefully other engineers will find useful."
