Hello and welcome to my personal blog!

My name is Aleksander Gondek; I am software developer, who has been lucky enough to gain a broad range of programming experiences so far – which I intend to share on this very website. I deeply hope you will enjoy reading its contents!

## About blog
The main purpose of this webiste is to share any valuable knowledge I have gained but have not found on the Internet yet, so that it will be more accessible to others.
The secondary goal of the blog is to develop my writting skills and motivate me to embark on new endavours.

**Caveat**: The blog contains my own opinions, which are in no way, shape or form representative of my current employer stance.

## About me
I like to think of myself as problem solver, as usually software creation is side-effect of having some business-related issue – key to creation of useful application is having the full understanding of its purpose. 

I take pride in my work, approaching software development as a form of expression, almost art, where I strive to deliver the finest application possible – for me it usually means choosing the right tools for the job at hand,  facilitating increased collaboration between interested parties, focusing on quality, automating every possible process and ensuring that the feedback incorporation loop is quick enough for the end-user to have meaningful impact on the project. 

Throughout my career I have become a firm believer in the DevOps movement, as its ideas strongly resonate with my personal experiences and seem to encourage best practices. 

What I am not a believer of is specialization – personally I think it is better to know in “shallow” manner different solutions to given problem (and the reason why they were invented), than to posses deep understanding of only one solution. 
Therefore, I never stop learning; I am continuously developing, acquiring new skills in different technologies and development approaches, trying my best to have a good overview over cutting-edge technologies.

They key practices I try my very best to follow are encompassed by the terms: [DevOps](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DevOpsCulture.html), [TDD](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/tdd-red-green-refactor), [Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org), Automation, [Continuous Delivery](https://continuousdelivery.com).

## About my interests
Besides myriad of computer-releated topics, I highly enjoy [tabletop role-playing games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game), reading (especially speculative fiction or history), watching movies and writting short-stories.

## Contact
My prefered way of communication is via LinkedIn, but you can also write to me on the following email address - ```<my_surname><my_name> at hotmail.com```
