I am software developer with a broad range of experiences and a deep passion for my work. I like to think of programming as a form of expression, an art and I strive to create the finest applications I can.

Since I do not believe that specialization is good way to progress any career, I have never stopped learning and I am continuously developing and acquiring new skills 
in different technologies and development approaches. Even though I sometimes do not agree with latest trends I still learn them, to have a better grasp on cutting-edge technologies.

I am eager DevOps, TDD and Agile practitioner and recently I have started taking great interest in Rust-programming language which strikes me as possible C++ successor.
